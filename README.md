# pkmn-type-coverage

A tool to know which Pokémon are weak or resistant to the selected type combo in Pokémon (up to Generation 9). This tool is inspired from [Pokémondb type coverage tool](https://pokemondb.net/tools/type-coverage). The code is adapted from [Pokémon Odyssey Type Coverage](https://github.com/nterrien/pkmn-odyssey-type-coverage)

Data and sprites https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi/.

## Modify
If you want to edit this tool for another game, you only have to edit files in the data folder, the pokémon list is stored in pokemon.js, and contains the pokemon name, types and abilities. The type chart can be edited in type-chart.js. Ability that changes damage of a type (like Levitate or Dry Skin) can be added or changed in abilities.js.
